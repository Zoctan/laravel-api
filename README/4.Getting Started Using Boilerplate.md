# Getting Started Using Boilerplate

## [Setting Up](https://github.com/specialtactics/laravel-api-boilerplate/wiki/Installation)

```
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret
php artisan ide-helper:generate
php artisan ide-helper:meta
```

This boilerplate adds several additional configuration files you should be aware of.

> api.php - Dingo API Configuration
> jwt.php - Tymon JWT Configuration
> stubs.php - This loads custom API stubs for certain artisan generators

## [Route, Controller and Model](https://github.com/specialtactics/laravel-api-boilerplate/wiki/Getting-Started)

You can create all of these things (and more!) with one simple command. If we wanted to make a new "book" resource for example, we would run;

```
./artisan make:api-resource Book
```

You will find this creates a lot of useful things, including:

> Model, Controller
> Migration, Seed
> Policy

## [JWT](https://github.com/specialtactics/laravel-api-boilerplate/wiki/Security)

Generate a `public/private key pair` and put them inside of the directory `resources/keys`.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwt.key
openssl rsa -in jwt.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwt.key.pub
```

## [Migration](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/migrations)

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition.

To run all of your outstanding migrations, execute the `migrate` Artisan command:

```
php artisan migrate
```

The `migrate:refresh` command will roll back all of your migrations and then execute the `migrate` command. This command effectively re-creates your entire database:

```
php artisan migrate:refresh
 
// Refresh the database and run all database seeds...
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
```

To roll back the latest migration operation, you may use the `rollback` Artisan command. This command rolls back the last "batch" of migrations, which may include multiple migration files:

```
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

The `migrate:reset` command will roll back all of your application's migrations:

```
php artisan migrate:reset
```
