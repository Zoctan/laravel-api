# Installation

## Installation Via Composer

Build a project with Laravel framework:

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

# Deployment

Generate app key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

## CLI

You may start Laravel's local development server using the Artisan CLI's serve command:

```
php artisan serve
```

## Apache

Default .htaccess file is in `/public` folder.

Visit index url: http://localhost/laravel-api/public/index.php

## [Nginx](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/deployment#nginx)


# API

If you plan to use Laravel as the API backend, you may want to check out our documentation on [routing](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing), [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum), and the [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent).

## Using [dingo/api](https://github.com/dingo/api/)

### [Installation](https://github.com/dingo/api/wiki/Installation)

Modify your `composer.json` file and run `composer update` to include the latest version of the package in your project.

```
"require": {
    "dingo/api": "^3.0.0"
}
```

### [Configuration](https://github.com/dingo/api/wiki/Configuration)

Much of the package comes preconfigured so that you can start building your API as soon as possible. You can use your `.env` file to configure most of the package, however, some finer tuning of the package will require you to either publish the configuration file (Laravel).

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Dingo\Api\Provider\LaravelServiceProvider"
```

You may also use the boot method of your `AppServiceProvider`.

### [API Endpoints](https://github.com/dingo/api/wiki/Creating-API-Endpoints)

After created endpoints, you can see the registered routes using Artisan.

```
php artisan api:routes
```

### [API Boilerplate](https://github.com/specialtactics/laravel-api-boilerplate)

If you are looking to start a new project from scratch, consider using the Laravel API Boilerplate, which builds on top of the dingo-api package, and adds a lot of great features.
